## Description

Don't assign same more than once.

## Motivation

Assigning more than once in the same scope makes reasoning harder.
```cs
public class Foo
{
    public Foo()
    {
        this.Bar = 1;
        ...
        this.Bar = 2;
        ...
    }

    public int Bar { get; }
}
```

## How to fix violations

Assign only once.

<!-- start generated config severity -->
## Configure severity

### Via ruleset file.

Configure the severity per project, for more info see [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264949.aspx).

### Via #pragma directive.
```C#
#pragma warning disable GU0015 // Don't assign same more than once.
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GU0015 // Don't assign same more than once.
```

Or put this at the top of the file to disable all instances.
```C#
#pragma warning disable GU0015 // Don't assign same more than once.
```

### Via attribute `[SuppressMessage]`.

```C#
[System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Gu.Analyzers.Correctness", 
    "GU0015:Don't assign same more than once.", 
    Justification = "Reason...")]
```
