## Description

Prefer injecting.

## Motivation

This is an analyzer that can be helpful if you refactoring legacy code to use an IoC-container.
This analyzer is expensive and you probably only want to enable it when refactoring.
It changes references that are newed up to be injected.
Candidates for injection are:
- Not in namespace `System`
- Reference types
- With empty ctor or only ctor arguments that are injected.

Sample code before:

```c#
public class Foo
{
    private readonly Bar bar;

    public Foo()
    {
        this.bar = new Bar();
    }
}

public class Bar
{
}
```

Remarks:

Useful when refactoring to using IoC-container.
Remarks:
There is an UNSAFE version of the code fix that handles:

```C#
public class Meh : Foo
{
    public Meh(Baz baz)
        : base(baz.Bar)
    {
    }
}
```

and changes it to:

```C#
public class Meh : Foo
{
    public Meh(Baz baz, Bar bar)
        : base(bar)
    {
    }
}
```

This is for cleaning up service locator messes.

## How to fix violations

Use the code fix or manually change the code to pass in the reference via ctor.
The above sample becomes:

```c#
public class Foo
{
    private readonly Bar bar;

    public Foo(Bar bar)
    {
        this.bar = bar;
    }
}

public class Bar
{
}
```

## Configure severity

### Via ruleset file.

Configure the severity per project, for more info see [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264949.aspx).

### Via #pragma directive.
```C#
#pragma warning disable GU0007 // Prefer injecting
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore GU0007 // Prefer injecting
```

Or put this at the top of the file to disable all instances.
```C#
#pragma warning disable GU0007 // Prefer injecting
```

### Via attribute `[SuppressMessage]`.

```C#
[System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Gu.Analyzers.Correctness", 
    "GU0007:Prefer injecting", 
    Justification = "Reason...")]
```
<!-- end generated config severity -->
